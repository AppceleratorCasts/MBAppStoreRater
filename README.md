MBAppStoreRater
===============
MBAppStoreRater is a non-intrusive invitation to rate your app on the App
Store.

To see an example, buy Favstand on the App Store (it's great and only $1).
Then use it for three days so it prompts you.

NOTE that MBAppStoreRater will work on iPhone, but you will need to do
some modifications to the MBNonIntrusiveView code to make it size
correctly. I've only tested this code on iPad so far. If you fix it,
please fork and submit a pull request!

NOTE this is the second time the rater is shown. The first time the first
button text reads "Not Now".
